		<p>Hei, I am Alexander Alemayhu ðŸ˜Š</p>
		<p>
			I started out learning about programming in order to make video games but left
			that in order to make a living on iOS applications. I've also dabbled in Android,
			Linux Networking, sysadmin stuff and security.

			Now a days I work as Web Developer but on my own time I am learning about
