![App icon](./img/kanatable.png)  

I am very fond of Japan and it's culture, during the summer of 2011 I got bored  
of learning kana from flash cards So I made kanatable. Kanatable is an ipad  
application for learning basic Japanese syllables. Kanatable was also my first  
app which was not work related that I uploaded to the app store.  

The application is powered with cocos2d.

### Tiny Path

April 20th-23rd 2012 I spent a weekend trying to make a game for an  
online competition Ludum dare.

I got to use cocos2d a whole lot and managed to make a game which  
was pretty fun.  Unfortunately the game is only for OSX > 10.6. If  
you want to try it, you can download it [here](./Tiny%20Path.zip) 

### Sphere

Learning from my first time, I choose to use webgl so more people  
could play my game in August 24th-27th 2012 Ludum dare competition.
